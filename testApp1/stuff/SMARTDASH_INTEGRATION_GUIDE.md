- ✅ Seamless transition from upload → processing → SmartDash

## 🚀 How to Use the Complete Workflow

### Step 1: Upload Basketball Cognitive Data
1. Navigate to the main page (`/`)
2. Upload a CSV file containing basketball cognitive performance data
3. Select processing options (optional)
4. Click "Process Data"

### Step 2: Automatic Detection & Processing
- The system automatically detects basketball cognitive performance data
- Data is processed using specialized basketball cognitive processor
- Both detailed data and performance summary are generated

### Step 3: Access SmartDash Analytics
- On the results page, you'll see a "Basketball Cognitive Performance Analysis" section
- Click "View SmartDash Analytics" button
- This takes you directly to the SmartDash dashboard with your data

### Step 4: Analyze with Tally Table
- View comprehensive performance metrics
- Examine the "Performance Action Tally" table
- Analyze action frequencies, patterns, and classifications

## 📊 SmartDash Features Available

### 1. **Performance Action Tally Table**
- **Column**: Performance category (Space Read, DM Catch, etc.)
- **Action**: Specific action performed
